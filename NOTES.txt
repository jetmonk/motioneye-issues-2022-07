In the morning, both internal  PI3 camera and external Arecont camera
were blanked out (camera-slash picture, but distorted).

Changing resolution of RPi camera within MotionEye brought them both to life.

Running on a RPi3

Cameras:  1 external arecont via ethernet
          2 RPi2 camera as an external rpi camera (seems to work)
	  3 Internal RPi3 camera


In uploadservices, camera 3 (RPi) has no Google Drive info, but I clicked
Test service and it said it succeeded - is it using Arecont's credentials?

The Arecont and RPi3 randomly went gray this morning. I hit the photo
button Arecont, and both cameras came back
